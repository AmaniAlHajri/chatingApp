#chattingApp

#For Database:
#As we know because it's Chatting app, it should have a real time DB, 
but because you want me only to practice on some specific language, I used normal 
and simple database structure which contains only two tables the first table 
is ‘User’ table which contains all the contact list and there information, the second table 
is ‘message’ table contains all the messages between any two different contacts (sender and receiver).

#For styling: 
#I used simple style because of limitation of the time! 
#I used: TailwindCSS, CSS. 


#To start tha application run the bellow command:
#docker-compose up
